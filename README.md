# sleep-detection
This project detects sleep by analyzing eye states in real-time using a webcam. It uses facial landmarks and eye aspect ratio (EAR) to determine drowsiness. If eyes remain closed beyond a threshold, an alert is triggered. Ideal for driver safety, fatigue monitoring, and health tracking using OpenCV and Dlib.
